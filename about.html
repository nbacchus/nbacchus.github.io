      <p class="aboutme">Hey there, Nadia is the name! Welcome to my online portfolio. Feel free to click around to see the kind of work I love doing and get to know me better. I’m currently  a student by day, professional barista by night and a brunch connoiseur on Sunday mornings. I’m majoring in public relations and minoring in journalism with the hopes of one day working in fashion or fitness public relations or graphic design.</p>
      <p>I appreciate all forms of art from an architecturally designed dress to graffitied walls to a perfectly composed salad. My hobbies include weightlifting, photography and falling asleep while watching Netflix. I wear boots 98% of the time despite being born and raised in the always hot and humid city of Miami. I’m passionate, determined and a quick learner when it comes to everything that I do. I believe the work that you do is a portrayal of yourself.Look through my online portfolio to see the different things that I have been involved in and have developed.</p>
